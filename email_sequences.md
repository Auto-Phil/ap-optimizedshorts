SUBJECT: made 5 shorts from your [recent video topic] videos

Hey [First Name],

Been watching your stuff for a while, and your [specific recent video title] video was genuinely great. Got me thinking, so I went ahead and made 5 Shorts from some of your best clips.

Here they are: [link to folder/playlist with 5 sample Shorts]

We'd love to partner with you to repurpose your existing content on an ongoing basis. If it makes sense for you to think about it, we've included some options below.
[link for free call with our team to discuss first]
[link to packs and pricing page] 50% off through February 14th

Honestly, we're just fans who also happen to do this for a living. Your long-form content deserves way more reach than it's getting.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [First Name]: creator's first name from their channel/about page
• [specific recent video title]: pick a recent video you genuinely enjoyed, reference something specific about it if possible
• [recent video topic]: 2-3 word topic summary for the subject line (e.g., "spider-man" or "budget tips")
• [link to folder/playlist with 5 sample Shorts]: Google Drive folder or unlisted YouTube playlist with all 5 Shorts

WHY THIS WORKS:
• 5 Shorts is a statement. It says "I actually sat with your content and cared enough to make a whole batch." The fan angle is genuine and disarming. No pitch, no CTA. Pure value delivery. They can't ignore someone who put in this much effort.

DELIVERABILITY NOTES:
• Word count: 72
• Links: 1 (the sample pack)

EMAIL 2 of 5: The Insight
Send: Day 3 of sequence

SUBJECT: your [channel niche] audience on shorts

---

Hey [First Name],

Quick thought on those 5 Shorts I sent over.

Creators in [their niche] with a similar sub count to yours are pulling 50K-200K views per Short, even when their long-form averages 10-30K. The algorithm treats them as a totally separate discovery channel.

Those 5 clips I made were just from [number] of your videos. Your full catalog has probably [estimated number] more sitting in it.

Curious if you've thought about it at all. We know timing is everything so, if the timing's right, the links below will get us started!

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [their niche]: "film commentary," "retro gaming," "personal finance," etc.
• [channel niche]: shorter version for subject line (e.g., "horror film" or "gaming")
• [number]: how many of their videos you actually pulled from to make the 5 Shorts (e.g., "3" or "2")
• [estimated number]: rough estimate: (longform_count * 2) is a safe ballpark (e.g., "200+" clips)

WHY THIS WORKS:
• References the pack of 5 naturally and reminds them the work is already done. Shares a real data point about Shorts performance. Then reframes the 5 Shorts as just a tiny fraction of what's possible from their library. Low-pressure question at the end invites a reply without demanding one.

SUBJECT: how [similar creator] added 40k subs in 3 months

---

[First Name],

They didn't change anything about how you make videos. Let's just give your existing content a second life. Same thing we did with the first 5 clips of yours [link to first 5 clips].

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if this makes sense for your channel?

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [similar creator name]: use a real client name if you have permission, otherwise anonymize by niche and size ("a retro gaming channel with 90K subs")
• [X]: their video count, to draw a parallel
• Adjust the numbers (40K subs, 25% views increase) to match your actual results. Never fabricate

WHY THIS WORKS:
• Social proof through a relatable story, then bridges it back to the 5 Shorts they already have. "Same thing I did with those 5 clips of yours" makes the case study feel personal, not generic. First real CTA, and 15 minutes feels low-commitment.

EMAIL 4 of 5: The Proof
Send: Day 11 of sequence
═══════════════════════════════════════════

SUBJECT: one more thing on those shorts

---

[First Name],

Last thing on this. I looked at your channel more closely and ran some rough numbers.

You have [longform_count] videos, most over [avg_duration] minutes. That's roughly [estimated_clips] potential Shorts sitting in your content right now. Based on what we see in [their niche], those could realistically pull [estimated monthly views] views per month combined.

The 5 I already made are yours to post whenever. We handle everything else from there: clipping, editing, captions, posting schedule. You don't touch anything.

Worth a conversation, or bad timing?

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [longform_count]: from your scraper data
• [avg_duration]: from avg_duration_seconds, converted to minutes
• [estimated_clips]: longform_count * 2-3 (conservative estimate)
• [estimated monthly views]: use comparable channels' Shorts performance as a benchmark
• [their niche]: "film commentary," "gaming," etc.

WHY THIS WORKS:
• Gets specific with THEIR numbers. Then casually reminds them the 5 Shorts are ready to go, which lowers the barrier to starting. The binary CTA ("worth a conversation, or bad timing?") makes replying easy even if the answer is no, and "bad timing" replies often convert later.

SUBJECT: should i close your file

---

[First Name],

Totally understand if the timing isn't right or this isn't a priority for your channel right now.

Those 5 Shorts are yours to keep and use however you want, no strings. I genuinely enjoy your content either way.

If you ever want to revisit this, just reply to any of these emails and I'll pick it right back up.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• No heavy personalization needed. The simplicity is the point
• "Those 5 Shorts" ties back to email 1 and reinforces the gift
• "I genuinely enjoy your content" reinforces the fan angle from email 1

WHY THIS WORKS:
• The breakup email consistently gets the highest reply rate in cold sequences. Giving away 5 finished Shorts with no strings creates strong reciprocity. The fan callback makes it feel human, not transactional. Many creators reply weeks or months later when they're ready.

• Word count: 65

# Sequence Strategy Brief

## 1. Timing and Cadence

| Email | Day | Gap | Why this gap |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Day 1 | N/A | Lead with the 5-pack while the content is fresh |
| 2 | Day 3 | 2 days | Quick follow-up while they remember the samples |
| 3 | Day 7 | 4 days | Give them breathing room before the social proof |
| 4 | Day 11 | 4 days | Enough time to not feel aggressive |
| 5 | Day 16 | 5 days | Longer gap makes the breakup feel genuine |

Best send times: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM in the recipient's local timezone. Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (mentally checked out).

## 2. Subject Line A/B Variants

| Email | Primary | Variant A | Variant B |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | made 5 shorts from your [topic] videos | pulled 5 clips from your channel | your [topic] videos as shorts |
| 2 | your [niche] audience on shorts | thought about your back catalog | something interesting about shorts in [niche] |
| 3 | how [creator] added 40k subs in 3 months | what happened when [creator] tried shorts | 40k new subs from existing videos |
| 4 | one more thing on those shorts | ran some numbers on your channel | your [X] videos as shorts |
| 5 | should i close your file | closing the loop | totally fine if not |

## 3. Reply Handling Guidance

**Positive reply ("Sure, let's chat" / "Tell me more" / "I watched the Shorts, they're great"):**
- Reply within 2 hours if possible, same day at latest
- Send a Calendly or specific time options (2-3 slots)
- Keep it short: "Awesome, glad you liked them. Here are a few times that work this week: [times]. Pick whatever's easiest."

**Objection reply ("Too expensive" / "Not sure about quality" / "I do my own shorts"):**
- Acknowledge their concern directly. Don't deflect
- "Totally fair. Most creators we work with felt the same way initially. You've already got the 5 samples. Those are the actual quality we deliver. Would it help if I showed you the results from [similar channel]?"
- If they do their own shorts: "That's great, not many in your niche do. If you ever want to scale the volume without the time investment, I'm around."

**"Not interested" / "Remove me":**
- Reply immediately: "Got it, appreciate you letting me know. Removing you now. Best of luck with the channel."
- Mark as "rejected" in your database. Never email again.

**No reply after sequence:**
- Wait 30-60 days, then consider a "reframe" email with a completely new angle (e.g., a new feature, a new case study, a trend in their niche). One email only, not a new sequence.

## 4. Personalization Playbook

| Data point | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| First name | Channel "About" page, or their social media bios |
| Recent video title | Their YouTube channel (use one from the last 2 weeks) |
| Niche | Your scraper's `primary_niche` field |
| Subscriber count | Your scraper's `subscriber_count` field |
| Long-form count | Your scraper's `longform_count` field |
| Avg duration | Your scraper's `avg_duration_seconds` field |
| Contact email | Your scraper's `contact_email` field |
| Social links | Channel "About" page (look for Instagram, Twitter) |
| Content style | Watch 2-3 minutes of their most popular video to understand their tone, then reference something specific in email 1 |

## 5. Sending Best Practices

**Domain warming (if using a new domain):**
- Week 1: Send 5-10 emails/day to people you know (colleagues, friends) who will open and reply
- Week 2: 15-20 emails/day, mix of warm and cold
- Week 3: 25-30/day
- Week 4+: Up to 40-50/day max

**Technical setup:**
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your sending domain
- Use a subdomain for cold outreach (e.g., outreach.auto-phil.com) to protect your main domain reputation
- Never send more than 50 cold emails per mailbox per day
- Spread sends throughout the day (not all at once)

**Daily volume from scraper context:**
- Your scraper finds 5-40 qualified channels per run
- At that volume, one Gmail account is sufficient
- If you scale beyond 50/day, add a second sending account
- Note: each lead requires creating 5 sample Shorts upfront, so factor production time into your daily capacity

## 6. Metrics to Track

| Metric | Good benchmark | Great benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Open rate | 50-60% | 70%+ |
| Reply rate (any reply) | 5-10% | 15%+ |
| Positive reply rate | 2-5% | 8%+ |
| Bounce rate | Under 3% | Under 1% |
| Spam complaint rate | Under 0.1% | 0% |

Note: With this sequence, your pack of 5 sample Shorts in email 1 should drive significantly higher reply rates than a typical cold sequence since you're leading with a substantial amount of delivered value. Expect email 1 and email 5 to generate the most replies.
