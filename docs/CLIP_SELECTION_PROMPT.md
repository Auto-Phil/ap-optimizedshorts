## Viral Clip Criteria (Score 1-10 for each)

### 1. **Immediate Hook (0-3 seconds)**
The clip must grab attention in the first 3 seconds. Look for:
- ✅ Bold statement or controversial opinion
- ✅ Surprising fact or statistic
- ✅ Visual payoff or "wait for it" moment
- ✅ Pattern interrupt (unexpected sound, movement, or reveal)
- ✅ Question that creates curiosity gap
- ❌ Slow build-up or context-setting (kills retention)

**Examples:**
- "This $5 item saved me $10,000"
- "I was completely wrong about this game"
- "Nobody talks about this hidden feature"

### 2. **Self-Contained Story (30-60 seconds)**
The clip must make sense without watching the full video. Look for:
- ✅ Complete thought or mini-story arc
- ✅ Setup → Tension → Payoff structure
- ✅ No references to "earlier in the video"
- ✅ Doesn't require prior knowledge
- ❌ Mid-sentence starts or abrupt endings

### 3. **Emotional Resonance**
The clip must trigger a strong emotion. Look for:
- ✅ Surprise/shock ("I can't believe that worked")
- ✅ Nostalgia ("Remember when...")
- ✅ Validation ("Finally someone said it")
- ✅ Humor/entertainment
- ✅ Inspiration/motivation
- ✅ Outrage/controversy (handled tastefully)
- ❌ Neutral, informational tone without emotion

### 4. **Visual Interest**
Even without audio, the clip should be engaging. Look for:
- ✅ On-screen graphics, B-roll, or demonstrations
- ✅ Expressive facial reactions
- ✅ Before/after comparisons
- ✅ Screen recordings with clear action
- ✅ Physical props or visual aids
- ❌ Static talking head with no visual variety

### 5. **Shareability**
Would someone send this to a friend? Look for:
- ✅ "You have to see this" moments
- ✅ Relatable experiences ("This is so true")
- ✅ Useful tips or life hacks
- ✅ Hot takes or unpopular opinions
- ✅ Satisfying reveals or conclusions
- ❌ Niche inside jokes or overly specific content

### 6. **Rewatch Value**
Would someone watch it multiple times? Look for:
- ✅ Dense information (requires multiple views to absorb)
- ✅ Satisfying payoff worth re-experiencing
- ✅ Quotable one-liners
- ✅ Easter eggs or details you notice on rewatch
- ❌ One-and-done content with no depth

### 7. **Comment Bait**
Does it invite discussion? Look for:
- ✅ Polarizing statements (respectfully)
- ✅ "What do you think?" moments
- ✅ Debatable opinions
- ✅ Calls to action ("Try this and let me know")
- ❌ Statements everyone agrees with (no discussion)

### 8. **Niche Fit**
Does it align with the creator's brand? Look for:
- ✅ Showcases their expertise
- ✅ Matches their usual tone/style
- ✅ Appeals to their existing audience
- ✅ Introduces new viewers to their niche
- ❌ Off-brand or confusing for their audience

## Clip Selection Strategy

### Prioritize These Moments:

1. **The "Aha!" Moment**
   - When the creator realizes something or has a breakthrough
   - "Wait, that's actually genius"
   - "I just figured out why this doesn't work"

2. **The Contrarian Take**
   - When they disagree with common wisdom
   - "Everyone says X, but actually Y"
   - "Here's why the popular opinion is wrong"

3. **The Satisfying Payoff**
   - When a build-up pays off perfectly
   - "And that's when it all clicked"
   - Before/after reveals

4. **The Relatable Struggle**
   - When they describe a universal frustration
   - "Has this ever happened to you?"
   - "We've all been there"

5. **The Unexpected Twist**
   - When something surprising happens
   - "You won't believe what happened next" (but actually)
   - Plot twists or reveals

6. **The Actionable Tip**
   - When they share a specific, useful technique
   - "Here's exactly how to do it"
   - Step-by-step mini-tutorials

7. **The Emotional Peak**
   - When they get genuinely excited, frustrated, or moved
   - Authentic reactions (not forced)
   - Passion shining through

8. **The Quotable Line**
   - When they say something memorable
   - One-liners that stick in your head
   - Phrases people will repeat

### Avoid These Moments:

- ❌ Intros or outros ("Hey guys, welcome back")

```
## CLIP #1: [Suggested Title]

**Timestamps:** [MM:SS] - [MM:SS] (Duration: XX seconds)

**Hook (0-3s):**
[What happens in the first 3 seconds that grabs attention]

**Core Value:**
[What the viewer learns, feels, or experiences]

**Payoff:**
[How the clip resolves or concludes satisfyingly]

**Viral Score:** X/10
- Hook: X/10

- Emotional Resonance: X/10
- Visual Interest: X/10
- Shareability: X/10
- Rewatch Value: X/10

```

## Ranking & Selection Logic

1. **Calculate viral score** for each potential clip (average of 8 criteria)
2. **Ensure variety** - Don't pick 5 clips that are all the same type
3. **Prioritize top performers** - Clips scoring 8+ should always be included
4. **Balance the pack:**
   - 2-3 "high-energy" clips (surprising, controversial, exciting)
   - 1-2 "educational" clips (actionable tips, explanations)
   - 1 "relatable" clip (emotional resonance, shared experience)

4. **Check for redundancy** - If two clips make the same point, pick the stronger one
5. **Front-load the best** - Clip #1 should be the highest-scoring (this is what they'll see first)

## Example Output (Abbreviated)

```
## CLIP #1: "This $2 Trick Saved Me $10,000"

**Timestamps:** 14:32 - 15:18 (Duration: 46 seconds)

**Hook (0-3s):**
"I can't believe I didn't know this sooner" + visual of before/after bank statements

**Core Value:**
Specific, actionable money-saving technique with real numbers

**Payoff:**
Shows exact savings over 6 months with proof

**Viral Score:** 9.1/10
- Hook: 9/10 (bold claim + visual proof)
- Self-Contained: 10/10 (complete story)
- Emotional Resonance: 9/10 (relief + validation)
- Visual Interest: 8/10 (on-screen graphics)
- Shareability: 10/10 ("you have to try this")
- Rewatch Value: 8/10 (want to remember the steps)
- Comment Bait: 9/10 ("does this actually work?")
- Niche Fit: 10/10 (perfect for personal finance)

**Why This Will Perform:**
Opens with a relatable pain point (wasting money), delivers a specific solution with real proof, and creates urgency ("why didn't I know this?"). The before/after visual makes it instantly shareable, and the specific dollar amount ($10K) is concrete enough to drive comments and saves.

**Suggested Caption:**
"I wish someone told me this 5 years ago 💰 This simple trick saved me $10,000. Try it and let me know your results! #personalfinance #moneytips #financialfreedom"

**Editing Notes:**
- Add text overlay at 0:02: "$10,000 SAVED"
- Zoom in on bank statement at 0:15
- Add captions for accessibility
- Cut the 2-second pause at 0:38
```

## Final Notes

- **Be ruthless** - Only select clips that genuinely have viral potential. It's better to find 3 amazing clips than 5 mediocre ones.
- **Think like a viewer** - Would YOU stop scrolling for this? Would YOU share it?
- **Respect the creator's brand** - Don't pick clips that misrepresent their content or take things out of context.
- **Optimize for the algorithm** - YouTube Shorts rewards high retention, rewatches, and engagement. Prioritize clips that drive these metrics.

---

**Remember:** These 5 clips are a sales tool. They need to be so good that the creator immediately sees the value and wants more. Quality over quantity. Make every clip count.
